# Rooms and Portals
## Introduction
The rooms and portals system is an optional component of Godot that allows you to partition your game levels into a series of rooms (aka cells), and portals which are openings between the rooms that the camera can see through.

This allows several features:
* Portal occlusion culling
* Gameplay callbacks, allowing turning off activity outside the gameplay area
