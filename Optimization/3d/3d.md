# 3d Optimization - supplemental

## Culling & Overdraw
Godot will automatically perform view frustum culling in order to prevent rendering objects that are outside the viewport. This works well for games that take place in a small area, however things can quickly become problematic in larger levels.

### Occlusion
Walking around a town for example, you may only be able to see a few buildings in the street you are in, as well as the sky and a few birds flying overhead. As far as a naive renderer is concerned however, you can still see the entire town. It won't just render the buildings in front of you, it will render the street behind that, with the people on that street, the buildings behind that etc. You can quickly end up in situations where you are attempting to render 10, or 100x more than is necessary.

Things aren't quite as bad as they seem, because the z buffer usually allows the GPU to fully shade the objects that are at the front. However the costs of the unneeded objects can still be considerable.

One way we can potentially reduce the amount to be rendered is to take advantage of occlusion. As yet there is no built in support for occlusion in Godot, however with careful design you can still get many of the advantages.

For instance in our city street scenario, you may be able to work out in advance that you can only see two other streets, B and C, from street A. Streets D to Z are hidden. In order to take advantage of occlusion, all you have to do is work out when your viewer is in street A (perhaps using Godot Areas), then you can hide the other streets.

This is a manual version of what is known as a 'potentially visible set'. It is a very powerful technique for speeding up rendering. You can also use it restrict physics or AI to the local area, and speed these up as well as rendering.

### Other occlusion techniques
There are other occlusion techniques such as portals, automatic PVS, and raster based occlusion culling. Some of these may be available through addons, and may be available in core Godot in the future.
