# General Optimization
## Introduction
In an ideal world, computers would run at infinite speed, and the only limit to what we could achieve would be our imagination. In the real world, however, it is all too easy to produce software that will bring even the fastest computer to its knees.

Designing games and other software is thus a compromise between what we would like to be possible, and what we can realistically achieve while maintaining good performance.
